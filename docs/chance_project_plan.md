# CHANCE (Cryptocurrency High-risk Analysis and Novelty Coin Estimator) Project Plan

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
### Scope
- Collect data on a wide range of cryptocurrencies for initial analysis.
### Data Points
- **Market Data**: Historical prices, volume, market cap, trading volumes.
- **Public Sentiment**: Data from social media, news platforms, and forums.
- **Macroeconomic Data**: Global economic indicators.
- **On-chain Metrics**: Transaction volume, wallet addresses, hash rates.
- **Transaction Fees**: Data on transaction fees for each cryptocurrency.
### Sources
- APIs like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, CryptoCompare, Blockchain.com.
### Storage
- Efficiently structure and store data in MongoDB.

## 2. Data Processing and DataFrame Creation
### Data Extraction
- Use Pythonâ€™s `pymongo` to retrieve data from MongoDB.
### DataFrame Structure
- Organize data into DataFrames with `pandas`.

## 3. Data Validation and Cleaning
- Implement robust processes for data validation and cleaning to ensure high data quality.

## 4. Broad Modeling and Analysis
### Historical Performance Analysis
- Identify characteristics of historically successful coins.
### Feature Engineering
- Develop features using `pandas` and `numpy`.
### Broad Modeling
- Apply Random Forest Regression with `scikit-learn`.

## 5. Model Explainability
- Incorporate techniques to interpret and understand model predictions.

## 6. Selection of Coins for In-depth Analysis
### Coin Selection Criteria
- Select coins based on patterns similar to successful historical coins.
### Focused Analysis
- Conduct detailed analysis on selected coins.

## 7. Backtesting and Portfolio Simulation
### Portfolio Management Strategy
- Maintain 100% investment at all times, reallocating as necessary.
- Account for transaction fees in all simulations.
### Backtesting
- Test the model's effectiveness historically.
### Performance Evaluation
- Use ROI, Sharpe ratio, and established benchmarks for evaluation.

## 8. Risk Management Framework
- Develop and implement a risk management strategy, including stop-loss limits and diversification.

## 9. Automated Data Updates
- Set up automated processes for continuous data collection and updates.

## 10. Error Logging and Monitoring System
- Implement a system for error logging and monitoring the system's health.

## 11. User Interface for Monitoring
- Develop a user interface for real-time monitoring of system performance and portfolio state.

## 12. Scalability Considerations
- Plan infrastructure for scalability in data processing and model deployment.

## 13. Analysis, Iteration, and Monitoring
### Performance Metrics
- Continuously evaluate model performance.
### Model Refinement
- Regularly refine the model based on results and new market data.
### Market Monitoring
- Adapt strategy based on market changes.

## 14. Risk Management and Compliance
### Risk Assessment
- Acknowledge risks in cryptocurrency investments.
### Compliance and Ethics
- Ensure legal and ethical compliance in all practices.

## 15. Real-World Testing and Implementation
### Paper Trading
- Test the strategy against current market conditions with simulated trading.

## 16. Documentation and Reporting
### Detailed Documentation
- Maintain comprehensive records of methodologies, models, and analyses.
### Reporting
- Generate reports on model performance and investment strategies.

## Key Considerations
- **Thorough Data Analysis**: Capture nuanced patterns in cryptocurrency performance.
- **Dynamic Modeling Approach**: Adapt the model to market trends and new data.
- **High-Quality Data**: Prioritize the relevance and quality of collected data.
- **Market Volatility**: Prepare for the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market.
